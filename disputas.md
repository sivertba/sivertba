I am currently a PhD student in engineering cybernetics with interest in such fields as computer vision and Image Processing, Artificial Intelligence, Data Science, Big Data Analytics, Robotics and Control System Design, and more ...

### Current Focus
[Currently Associated With NTNU AMOS](https://www.ntnu.edu/amos)

Working on coordinated oceanographic observation system with autonomous aerial/surface robots and hyper-spectral imaging in Smallsat. The research project will consider small satellites with a hyper-spectral camera as an intelligent agent in tightly controlled and coordinated missions involving also unmanned aerial vehicles and unmanned surface vehicles, where the autonomous agents can exchange information to solve joint mission tasks. Oceanographic applications in marine biology will be developed together with collaborators to demonstrate the benefits of the research.
